## Introduction

This lecture focuses on Networking, Mobile Computing, Internet of Things. And it also focuses on how is information transported and how to make communications efficient.

This repo contains two assignments:

1. Implementation of TCP and UDP servers and clients with `Python2.7`  
    you can find the code [here](./Assignment_TCP_UDP)

2. The solutions of Queueing Theory (Random Process) and Network Optimization (A Math Approach)
    1. Queueing Theory
        Find the stationary distribution of an M/M/2/6 queue where $\lambda = 1, \mu = 2$.

        you can find the code of M/M/2/6 [here](./Assignment_Queueing_Optimization/MM26.py)

        you can find the code of M/M/5/10 [here](./Assignment_Queueing_Optimization/MM510.py)

    2. Network Optimization
        you can find the questions [here](./Assignment_Queueing_Optimization/Assignment_Questions.pdf) and solutions [here](./Assignment_Queueing_Optimization/Assignment_Solutions.pdf)
